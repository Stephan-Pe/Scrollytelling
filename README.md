# Scrollytelling => IntersectionObserver API => WebComponents

1. You can download the zip or clone the Repository
2. run npm init

For this little project I'am filling the index page with two web components adding some interaction with the IntersectionObserver API

The layout is not responsive and the menu button has no functionality.

Happy Coding ;-)
